| Jan 16 | 9am - 4pm | [Introduction to R](r-intro/index.html)                                                            | Learn the basics of R & Rstudio, how to write your own R scripts and get an introduction to the tidyverse. We'll start with the beginning and quickly get you up to speed with the basic tools of data exploration. You will learn how to import and manage data sets, create R objects, install and load R packages, and how to ask for help in R.                                                                                       |
| Jan 17 | 9am - 4pm | [Graphics with `ggplot2`](r-graphics/index.html)                                                   | `ggplot2` provides a framework to produce elegant, high-end graphical displays using the Grammar of Graphics. You will learn how to create a wide variety of graphical displays in R. We will use lots of data examples to wok through the basic plots as well as more advanced tools, such as facetting, colors, themes and more.                                                                                                        |
| Jan 18 | 9am - 4pm | [Data Wrangling](r-format/index.html)                                                              | This workshop will to prepare you for dealing with messy data by walking you through real-life examples. We will help you to automate cleaning your data, fixing spelling errors, transforming variables, and generating data summaries using the split-apply-combine paradigm. We will also talk about wide and long format data and help you to convert between these formats and to know when each format is useful.                   |
| Jan 19 | 9am - 4pm | [Statistical Modeling in R](r-modeling/index.html) | Learn how to fit models, test hypotheses, create model output tables and plots, and more! In the morning, we will cover model-fitting basics (linear regression, mixed models), and in the afternoon we will look into more advanced types of models (generalized linear mixed models, etc.). <br/> The last part of this session is designed as a workshop, so bring your data to analyze (we will have some data sets if you need one!) |
