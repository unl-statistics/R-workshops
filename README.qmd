# January 2024 - A Week of R

The schedule listed below is for the next set of workshops. Workshops are typically offered just before the classes start in the Spring as well as the week after Spring finals. We anticipate that these classes will be offered in person, with no online option.

## Schedule

**Schedule is tentative and subject to change due to enrollment and lab availability**

-   Location: Hardin 163 (North wing)
-   Required materials: Laptop with [software installed](@sec-setup)

Register for the workshops [here](`r registration_link`).

We will send you an email about a week before the workshops are held with additional details.

{{< include schedule.qmd >}}

## Pricing

These workshops are developed and hosted by Statistics graduate students to assist UNL students, faculty, and staff with developing the R skills necessary for research and data analysis. 
Individuals from outside the university are welcome to participate. 
Proceeds from the workshops directly fund graduate student activities.

{{< include pricing.qmd >}}

We accept exact cash, checks, or a University cost object. We cannot accept N-cards.

### Corporate Group Rate

If you are anticipating registering more than 4 people who are **not UNL Affiliates** as a group, please feel free to contact [Susan Vanderplas](mailto:svanderplas2@unl.edu?subject=R%20Workshops%20Pricing) for a group rate.

### Independent Students (not part of a research lab)

If you are an independent student (e.g. not part of a research lab), and cannot afford the prices we've set, please contact [Susan Vanderplas](mailto:svanderplas2@unl.edu?subject=R%20Workshops%20Pricing) about **1 week before the workshops are scheduled to see if scholarships are available.** 

Include in your email how much you can afford to pay, why you need the workshops, and any other details you think are relevant. 
Scholarships will depend on the number of registered participants. 
We charge just enough to ensure that the instructors are paid for their time and effort, which is why scholarships depend on registration (which is not known until about a week before workshops start).
:::


Note that half-day workshops are those which are only offered from e.g. 9-12 or 1-4. We do not allow you to register and pay for only half of a full-day workshop.

# Computer Setup {#sec-setup}

You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed:

-   [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (version 4.0.0 or greater)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) (version 2021.09 or greater)
-   Windows only:\
    [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
-   In R, please run the following code:

``` r
# this may take a LONG time...
install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "rvest", "xml2", "tinytex", "lme4", "emmeans")) 

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You will need to make sure that you have sufficient permissions on your machine to install R packages from CRAN. If you do not have admin access to your own machine, please work with your administrator to ensure that you can install R packages during the workshop if necessary, as this is an important skill to learn.
