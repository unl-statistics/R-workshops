The course will be a mix of instruction and follow-up exercises. It will be held in a computer lab but you are encouraged to bring your own laptops, with software already loaded. A list of software is available to help you prepare your machine for the workshop.

After the end of Graphics with ggplot, we expect you to be able to do the following:

+ Visualize data in the ggplot2 package: do basic plots, as well as know about the layer system, and be able to structure complex graphics
+ Take a data set and use static graphics to look for interesting features.
+ Know about some aspects of human perception and what to avoid when plotting data.
