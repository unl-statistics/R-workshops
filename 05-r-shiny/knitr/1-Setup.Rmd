## What is `shiny`?

**Shiny** is an R package that allows you to easily create interactive web applets using R. 

- Produced by [RStudio](http://shiny.rstudio.com)
- Code can be entirely within R (or customize with HTML/JavaScript)
- Take a look at RStudio's [showcase](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) of Shiny applets
