The Interactive R Applets with Shiny workshop will teach you how create interactive web applets that allow users to interact with your data and statistical analyses in a user-friendly setting. These applets are fantastic for teaching, but are also useful for reporting your data interactively. In addition, they are also very simple to create, and you don't have to know how to use HTML and JavaScript to make them! Learn how to combine the statistical power of R with user-friendly, interactive webpages in this 3-hour session.

The course will be very hands-on: after we show you the basics of Shiny, we will spend the remainder of the workshop helping you create your very own applet to take home. If you have data and graphics you would like to make into an interactive applet, bring them with you; otherwise, we will provide some interesting data for you to work with during the workshop. It will be held in a computer lab but you are encouraged to bring your own laptops, with software already loaded. A list of software will be available at this site several days prior to the workshop.
