# Messy data

 *Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way. - Leo Tolstoy*  
<br/>

**Five main ways tables of data tend not to be tidy:**

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.

2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.

3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.

# Why Data Wrangling?

What is data wrangling?
+ Reading in files from various formats (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .sps, .xport)
+ Summarizing Data using dplyr (Toolbox of data cleaning function)
+ Tidy Data for future analyses and reproducibility
+ Joining Data from different Data Sources

Data Wrangling offers the flexibility of collaboration with other formats.

One of the main reasons for data wrangling is to use any type of data.
