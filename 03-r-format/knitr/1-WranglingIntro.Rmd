+ Reading in files from various formats (.xls, .xlsx, .csv, .txt, .sps, .xport)
+ Summarizing Data using dplyr (Toolbox of data cleaning function)
+ Tidy Data for future analyses and reproducibility
+ Joining Data from different Data Sources

One of the main reasons for data wrangling is to use any type of data.

## What is Data Wrangling?

**Data wrangling** can be defined as the process of cleaning, organizing, and transforming raw data into the desired format for analysts to use for prompt decision-making. Also known as data cleaning.

## Why do you need this "Data Wrangling" Skill?

- Data wrangling helps to improve data usability as it converts data into a compatible format for the end system. 

- It helps to quickly build data flows within an intuitive user interface and easily schedule and automate the data-flow process.

- Integrates various types of information and their sources (like databases, web services, files, etc.)

- Help users to process very large volumes of data easily and easily share data-flow techniques.

**Five main ways tables of data tend not to be tidy:**

1. Column headers are values, not variable names.

2. Multiple variables are stored in one column.

3. Variables are stored in both rows and columns.

4. Multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table.

5. A single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.
