The course will be a mix of instruction and follow-up exercises. It will be held in a computer lab but you are encouraged to bring your own laptops, with software already loaded. A list of software is available to help you prepare your machine for the workshop.

After the end of Statistical Modeling in R, we expect you to be able to do the following:

-   Fit models (linear regression, anova, mixed models, generalized linear mixed models)
-   Test hypotheses
-   Create model output tables and plots

**Note:** This workshop day is not a substitute for courses such as 801 and 802 which teach ANOVA, regression, some experimental design, etc. The goal is to teach you how to implement these models in R and extract and display the output; we will not be teaching experimental design or the statistical details of each test and model.
