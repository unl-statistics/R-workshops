The course will be a mix of instruction and follow-up exercises. It will be held in a computer lab but you are encouraged to bring your own laptops, with software already loaded. A list of software is available to help you prepare your machine for the workshop.

After the end of Statistical Modeling in R, we expect you to be able to do the following:

+ Fit models (linear regression, anova, mixed models, generalized additive models, generalized linear mixed models)
+ Test hypotheses
+ Create model output tables and plots
