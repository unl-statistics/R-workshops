# Project Management

- Important to understand your file structure and where you save everything
- Working directory 
 + "Default location where R will look for files you want to load and where it will put any files you save" [source](https://intro2r.com/work-d.html)

```{r, eval = FALSE}

#Returns the file path of the current working directory
getwd()

#Set Working Directory
setwd()

```

  - Session -> Set Working Directory -> Choose Directory
  - Point and Click Method

## Project Management: R Projects

- What is R Projects?
  + When working on your research it is beneficial to keep all associated files with a project together. 
  + Sets your working directory for you
- How to Create One?
  + File -> New Project -> New Directory -> New Project
  + If already have a folder created: File -> New Project -> Existing Directory 
  + This will take you to a page where you create a folder and then the file path to that folder (subdirectory)
