| May 16 | 9am - 4pm  | [Introduction to R](https://srvanderplas.github.io/rwrks/01-r-intro/index.html) | Learn the basics of R & Rstudio, how to write your own R scripts and get an introduction to the tidyverse. We’ll start with the beginning and quickly get you up to speed with the basic tools of data exploration.
