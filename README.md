If you are anticipating registering more than 4 people who are **not UNL
Affiliates** as a group, please feel free to contact [Susan
Vanderplas](mailto:svanderplas2@unl.edu?subject=R%20Workshops%20Pricing)
for a group rate.

We accept exact cash, checks, or a University cost object. We cannot accept N-cards.

# First Day Setup!

You will need to bring a laptop with the following software installed:

-   [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) (version 4.0.0 or greater)
-   [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    (version 2021.09 or greater)
-   \[Windows only\]
    [Rtools](https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/)
-   In R, please run the following code:

``` r
# this will take a LONG time...
install.packages(c("knitr", "rmarkdown", "tidyverse", "rvest", "xml2", "tinytex")) 

tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

You will need to make sure that you have sufficient permissions on your
machine to install R packages from CRAN. If you do not have admin access
to your own machine, please work with your administrator to ensure that
you can install R packages during the workshop if necessary, as this is
an important skill to learn.
