```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

You can test if \textbf{knitr} works with this minimal demo. OK, let's get started with some boring random numbers:

```{r boring-numbers}
set.seed(1121)
x=rnorm(20)
mean(x)
var(x)
```

The first element of \texttt{x} is 0.145. Boring boxplots
and histograms recorded by the PDF device:

```{r boring-plots, fig.width=10, fig.height=6, out.width='.9\\linewidth'}

## two plots side by side
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
boxplot(x)
hist(x,main='')

```

Do the above chunks work? You should be able to compile the PDF Document.
